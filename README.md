# MQTT-server

Just an MQTT server. It launches a program that searches for neighbors around it, exchanges messages using the example of broadcast, collecting information about the network, monitors the status of neighbors, notifies each other of someone's fall, and rebuilds the network. It works in a bidirectional ring topology.
